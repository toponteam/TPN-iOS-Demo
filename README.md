### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like the TopOn-iOS-SDK in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```
$ gem install cocoapods
```

**Podfile**
To integrate TPNSDKiOS SDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

```shell
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'You Project Name' do
      pod 'TPNSDKiOS','sdk_version'
end
```

#### Subspecs
